# Harry-Potter-TextBased-Game
Using Object Oriented Design to create a simple textbased game 

The purpose of this text-based game was to practice the implementation of Object Oriented Design in Java. The game is 
based on the story of Harry Potter. The player is able to input certain commands, from a list of moves, into the console to
progress through the game. At the end of the game the player is able to get a Key that allows the user to have access to the
final boss which is Lord Voldemort.

# What I Learned:

- Learned how to use Object Oriented Design in Java through the use of concepts such as Wrappers.
- Got a better foundation in coding with Java classes and relationships that are made through Parent classes and inheritence. 
- Learned Polymorphism
- Learned better programming skills in regards to what the user should have access to and what they should not.
